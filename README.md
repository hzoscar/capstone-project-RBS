# Capstone-project-RBS
This capstone project focuses on segmenting ORA-FASHIONâ€™s customer base to enhance loyalty 
and retention through targeted marketing strategies. By employing Recency, Frequency, and 
Monetary (RFM) analysis in conjunction with unsupervised clustering algorithms, customers were 
effectively segmented into distinct groups based on their purchasing behaviors. Additionally, an 
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted, and Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) was 
calculated to enrich the segmentation analysis. The clustering validity was confirmed using metrics 
like the Silhouette Score and Davies-Bouldin Index. These insights will drive personalized 
marketing efforts, optimizing customer engagement and driving long-term business growth.
